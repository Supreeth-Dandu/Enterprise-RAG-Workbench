# Enterprise RAG Benchmark

This project explores how enterprise-style RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems are built in practice.

It focuses on the core pieces that actually matter in real-world setups:
- Document ingestion
- Chunking strategies
- Embeddings
- Vector storage

The goal is to understand how different design choices affect retrieval quality and system behavior, not just to build a demo.

More experiments and improvements will be added over time.
